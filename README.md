# BoardgamePrices

The goal of this project is to explore and playing around with different concepts of Python programming, including:

- Web Scraping;
- Script Scheduling;
- Logging;
- Linting;
- Git Hooks;
- ... maybe more.

The end product will be a program that scrapes specific websites for boardgame prices daily, storing that information, and later crunch the collected data looking for trends or fluctuations in pricings. The resulting analysis will either be stored in some file format, or perhaps at some point hosted on a webpage. Additional concepts might be added and explored further on as the project grows and moves along.

Constructive comments, suggestions, and criticisms are all welcome!
